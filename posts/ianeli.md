## The why

My [old portfolio](https://old.ianeli1.com/) was starting to show its age and the level of experience I had when I made it (2020!). Ok, it was not that long ago, nonetheless I've been getting better since. And using Create-React-App definitely wasn't the best solution for a static website.

Now, it wasn't a bad site, I managed to squeeze a ton of work in just a ~250kB download. It's just one page that's completely rendered on the client side.

## The how

I decided to use Next.js as the React framework for this site. The best thing about it is that it's _really easy_ to get things right by using it. You don't have to worry about routing, API solutions, static site generation, optimization (for the most part...) since the framework provides a really vast set of tools for you already.

I usually don't like using React components from NPM, and this isn't the exception. Apart from the `<Link />` components from Next.js, this site is completely hand-crafted. (And it shows! Don't try to open it on your phone... yet!)

I've been recently using TailwindCSS for my projects, it's so easy and intuitive, so I decided to incorporate it here as well!

## The result

Well, I don't know yet!

As of now, the site is still being built. I'm really proud of it so far, though the `/blog` page can use some work.

I'm always looking forward to new projects, and I'm excited to be working on this one!
