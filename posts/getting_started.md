# The why

Whether you're looking to improve your skills, get into the field, or simply do it for fun, JavaScript has to be the most straight-forward way of getting started in software development.

Being the [most used language out there](https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-for-developers-javascript-rules-but-python-overtakes-java/), there are a vast amount of resources to learn from.

Below I'll try to provide the resources I've found most useful through my experience.

## [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

FreeCodeCamp is an free online platform for learning Web Development, Quality Assurance, Data Analysis and many others.

What I found most useful was their JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification (Yes! You can put these certifications on your LinkedIn profile). It introduces you to the language, its quirks, and various projects, which all certainly helped me to understand the versatility of JS.

If you're getting started with web development, be sure to take their Responsive Web Design and Front End Development courses too!

Not only do they offer free virtual courses, their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) is full of tutorials on every topic you can imagine.

## [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

The title of this e-book is pretty much self-explanatory. JavaScript being the language it is, it's had many changes over time that ended up resulting in many odd behaviors. This book makes sure to explain them all in detail, as well as all other core mechanisms that make up JS.

As the second edition is still being written, I suggest taking a look at the [first edition](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md).

## [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Once you work enough with JavaScript, you'll start to realize it's really easy to make dumb mistakes while using it. TypeScript aims to be an assistant by providing type definitions to everything.

If you've ever used a statically typed language (like C or Java), this will be of great use, as it provides a familiar experience.

What advantages does writing more code give you? It allows you to detect type errors way before deploying to production. Additionally, the Typescript _transpiler_ allows you to output JavaScript code of any era, and use new JavaScript features before they're implemented in your favorite environment.

Using libraries becomes surprisingly easy with TS. You no longer need the documentation at hand to know which properties an object has, as hovering the mouse over it will tell you.

## [Fireship Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA)

The Fireship channel provides videos on topics mostly focused on the latest JavaScript libraries. Their 100 seconds introductions give you a brief description yet they're able to get you onboard and coding really quick.

I would suggest getting started with their [JavaScript videos](https://youtu.be/Sh6lK57Cuk4).

## [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/)

While learning by yourself, there's a high chance you'll end up not knowing what to learn next. This website aims to solve that problem by giving you a curated list of topics to spend your time on.

There are available roadmaps for React, Front-end, Back-end, and DevOps.

## [Ben Awad's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenAwad97)

Ben is a Full-Stack developer and not only does he provide entertainment content, he has a variety of tutorials available.

My personal favorite has to be his 14 hour [Fullstack React GraphQL TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8), however I wouldn't recommend it until you have the basics of React and TypeScript down.

Be sure to check out his available playlists, his main focus is React development so you're bound to have a rich learning experience.

# Great tools

## [Vercel/Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)

Next.JS is my personal favorite framework for React. It supports server-side rendering, static site generation and incremental site generation (and it's what you're using to read this article!).

It's really easy to use, however I do spend a big chunk of my time reading their documentation.

Vercel offers completely free hosting and certificates for Next.JS apps. Great for building your portfolio!

## [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)

Following the theme of this post, Heroku offers free hosting for small web apps. Once you're ready to deploy your first bot/web app/portfolio/fun gag, be sure to give their tool a go.

[Here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) you can find a guide on how to deploy a Node.JS app on their platform.

## [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Oh, Docker! Docker is a great tool that allows you to run your webapp in pretty much any platform that supports Docker. Its main focus is for developers to forget about the "oh it works on my machine" excuse.

Once your application is ready to go, dockerize it. If it works on your machine, it'll work on every computer in the world.

Be sure to give [Fireship's videos on Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjnup-PuquQ&list=PL0vfts4VzfNjTHIOupS8u9cxTYtz5RPYU) a go.
